## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 5, Pt.1
This was a fun lab for me as we were calculating the area of a recantage. For me I was very challenged in this lab as I found it very complex, however I did enjoy it and calculating the area of the rectangle. In this lab we wrote functions for the first time that calculate the length, width of a rectangle.

Lab 7, Pt. 2
This was my favorite lab because I really enjoy the game of blackjack and although I know how it works.I was interested to learn more about it. In this part of the lab I wrote functions that were able to calculate the value of any blackjack hand dealt no matter how many Aces there were.

Lab 12, Pt.1
Although this was our last lab this was my second favorite because it was our first time making an animation. This lab was very interesting as we had to debug each color and later combine all three channels together and turn it into a GIF. We used C++ math library to help smoothly change the red and green channels.
